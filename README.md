## About The Project

<img src="src/img/prints/print.jpeg" alt="Print About Page"><br/>


I made this portfolio because I needed a platform to post my future projects, I know there is GitHub, but this platform is more devoted to Devs. As for the portfolio design, I was inspired by several on the internet, and I did mine with some changes.

- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org)
